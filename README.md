Halo Online Split Screen
------------------------
By: Blake Boris/PlGGS

The feedback I got from the original release of HOSS was incredible. I couldn't 
believe how many people were able to make use of it. After gathering all of the 
requested features, I was able to create the final release of HOSS for ED 0.5.1.1. 

0.6 will bring many new ways to increase the functionality of the program, but 
for now, this version will allow users to split the screens the way a console 
would. That in and of itself was a huge goal for this project. If you're 
constrained to one computer, console mode, along with many other improvements 
and fixes, makes this release the best way to play Eldewrito with your friends, 
period.

----------------
Version 0.1.0.0:
----------------

- Select the amount of instances to run
- Select each resolution
- Select each graphics setting
- enable/disable vertical sync
- enable/disable anti-aliasing
- Select whether or not keyboard controls P1
- enable/disable closing the launcher after a launch

------------------------

After installation, HOSS places a shortcut to the application in your Halo Online 
directory for all your customization purposes.

Connecting them all into their own private game is as simple as going into the 
'Host Multiplayer' menu and selecting host on one instance and join on all others.

While the server browser will only connect the first instance to an online game, 
if you make sure that either your server browser is set to 
[Vicelio's Menu](http://vicelio.github.io/menu/), or that you can just open that 
link in your browser to copy the IP address. Then you go into the instances of 
the game to paste 'server.connect YourIPHere' into the console and it will work. 
It's just a bit of extra work.

This program will use an average of 16gb of storage space on your PC upon 
installation. Though this all depends on what you have inside your Eldewrito 
installation directory.
